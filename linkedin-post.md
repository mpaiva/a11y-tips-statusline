**Introducing a11y-tips-statusline: Learn WCAG While You Code**

What if every time you looked at your IDE, you learned something new about web accessibility?

I built a simple tool that displays random WCAG 2.2 tips directly in the Claude Code statusline. No extra windows. No context switching. Just passive, continuous learning while you work.

**What it shows:**
- All 87 WCAG 2.2 success criteria (Levels A, AA, and AAA)
- Random tip on each refresh
- Your current directory, git branch, model, and token usage

**Why I built this:**

Accessibility shouldn't be an afterthought. But let's be honest - most of us don't memorize all 87 WCAG success criteria. This tool helps bridge that knowledge gap by surfacing guidelines naturally throughout your workday.

Over time, you'll recognize patterns like:
- "1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)" when styling text
- "2.1.1 Keyboard" when adding interactions
- "1.1.1 Non-text Content" when working with images

**One-line install:**
```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mpaiva/a11y-tips-statusline/main/install.sh | bash
```

Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows (WSL).

Building accessible products starts with awareness. This is my small contribution to making the web more inclusive, one tip at a time.
